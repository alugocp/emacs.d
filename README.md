# Alex's Emacs setup
Yep, I'm an Emacs user now.

## Getting started
Make sure you delete your `~/.emacs` file or Emacs won't look for `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.
Run the following command to make this starter kit usable:

```sh
cp init.el.template init.el
```

## Todo
- [ ] Delete selected text if you hit another non-navigation key
- [ ] Make git diff lines more visible (change their colors)
- [ ] Add file tree view and multiple tabs
- [ ] Make line select select all highlighted lines (not just the one with the cursor)
- [ ] Figure out running a terminal shell in this thing
